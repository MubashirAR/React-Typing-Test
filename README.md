# React Typing Test

## About
As the name suggests, this project was made using React.js. You can take a test, register, login and view scores by different users. The scores and user accounts are stored in IndexedDB via a service and the data is shared across the app using React Context. Once a user is logged in, their data is stored into session storage so they stay logged in until the tab is open.
